## Introduction  
Meet the DJI Air 3S Fly More Combo—a dual-camera, travel-ready powerhouse designed for creators and professionals. With the feature-packed DJI RC 2 controller, this combo delivers not only extended flight time but a whole new level of creative flexibility, safety, and reliability.

## Dual-Camera Imaging & Video Excellence  
The Air 3S sports a 1” CMOS primary camera (50MP, 14 stops dynamic range) alongside a 70mm medium tele camera (48MP, 3x optical zoom). Both support 4K/60fps HDR and slow-motion at 4K/120fps, plus a 10-bit D-Log M color mode for pro-level color grading. Whether capturing sweeping landscapes or detailed portraits, every shot is crisp, vibrant, and cinematic.

## Intelligent Flight Modes & Safety  
Never worry about the environment—advanced obstacle sensing uses forward LiDAR, infrared ToF, and omnidirectional sensors to detect obstacles by day or night. Smart features like FocusTrack, Hyperlapse, QuickShots, and a fully automated dynamic ActiveTrack system let you create stunning shots with ease. The next-gen Smart RTH works reliably even without GPS lock, ensuring safe returns even in complex or unfamiliar settings.

## Adventure-Ready Endurance & Portability  
With up to 45 minutes flight time (per battery) and the O4 transmission system (20 km range, 1080p at 60fps), you can confidently explore, capture, and stream. The Fly More Combo gives you three Intelligent Flight Batteries, a charging hub, ND filters, extra propellers, and a shoulder bag—everything you need for non-stop shooting anywhere.
